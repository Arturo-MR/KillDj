KillDJ 2014(c)
==============
KillDJ is an online music store focused only on "Hard" genres. It is intended to boost the acknowledgement of the independant bands around the store, in order to create a simple way of difusion.

NOTE: This project is right now in an "extra-early" phase, there is no tangible advances in the arquitecture nor the design.
